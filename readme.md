# rTeX

[Deployed example here](http://rtex.probablyaweb.site/)

Minimal LaTeX rendering server.

Requirements:
- Python 3.5.2
- The libraries in `requirements.txt`
- An installation of LaTeX, of some description.
	- MikTeX and TeXLive both work decently.
- A command called `convert`. I think it's part of imagemagik but I'm not sure.
